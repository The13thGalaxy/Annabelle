History
--------------------

Annabelle's creation began in room BT250 of Northeastern Wisconsin Technical College on September 1st, 2017. The idea came from a small collection of data I was gathering to help me strategize my Overwatch play with my friends. I thought that if we could map out our strengths and help each other cover our weaknesses, we could easily have a bot that gives us that info with a simple command. 

Initally, the plan was to create Annabelle in C# as a sort of project for my C# class. However, when I realized I had no idea how to even write a "Hello World!" program in CS, I figured it would be easier on me if I simply just wrote it in my native language, Python. After abandoning the thought of Annabelle being an academic project, I thought it would be a good idea to make her a project that I would just do for fun. No deadlines, no worries, nothing making me feel like I was in a time crunch. And thus, Annabelle as she is today came to be. 

Acknowledgements
--------------------
My previous bot, BlitzKrieg, was a success in large part due to my good friend, Ikaheishi. Without her, my bot would've looked extremely sloppy. Along with her doing some editing to BlitzKrieg to make him look more presentable, she taught me a thing or two about Python. She showed me solutions I hadn't even considered at that point in time, and I'd like to thank her for being that person for me. It's not really all that easy to break through to me, in all honesty, and thus I appreciate her keeping at it and challenging me to be my best.

Secondly, I'd like to thank my coding teacher in my senior year of high school, Lucas Richards. While this may seem like an odd person to thank in a project completely unrelated to my college tuition, let alone high school, his class taught me some very valuable things about my coding potential. There were times I doubted my own ability in coding, and thought that I should give up. However, when I would present BlitzKrieg's progress to him every now and again, he never told me anything of the like. Instead, he always seemed impressed with what I had been able to accomplish. He challenged me to be my best and to try things that I never even thought I would be able to do. Without his help, I honestly probably would've ended up giving up on coding entirely. Now look at me, studying to be a software developer. Honestly, Mr. Richards. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your praise kept me going when I thought I should've given up on my passion. Sometimes I wonder if you even knew that.

That's about all I have to say. Thanks for taking the time to read this, and enjoy using Annabelle or an adaptation of her if that suits your fancy.
